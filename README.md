# NBA Player Shots Data Visualization

###

### Project Description
This is my side project which implement a data visualization base on NBA player. Actually I want to achieve a Soccer player data dashboard but there is no API like stats.nba.com can provide. 

This is Demo picture. You can achieve all functions I describe later by downloading and running "npm start" in terminal.

In general, I built a dashboard to visualize individual NBA player's shot data. It has a shot chart and 4 line/bar charts. It is realized by ReactJS, D3.js and antd library. 

### Project Details

1. I built a goals-number filter which you can find the player shots data in given number. 
2. I used the color and hexbin size to represent the efficiency and frequency which can provide more detailed visualization areas with made shots straightforwardly.

For example, like Stephen Curry
From this chart we can know he preferred to shotting on slight right of three point line. He shotted on this position at least 6 times with high accuracy. 

3. I implemented automatic association by using antd's autocomplement.
